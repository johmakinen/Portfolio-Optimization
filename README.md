### Next steps

- [x] Optimize asset portfolio using Monte Carlo sampling with uniform A priori distribution
- [x] Automate data retrieval
- [x] Dockerize + gunicorn
- [ ] Find a way to deploy our pipeline to the public (Heroku, AWS,...)
- [ ] Write extensive README with the theory behind the optimization
- [ ] Time series prediction -> Robust portfolio optimization using future scenarios (?)
